## Hi, I'm Micah. <sub><sup>a.k.a Apex, Gazehound, Dream, and a few more names...</sup></sub>

I am a programmer passionate about accessible application design and human-centered systems. I am most skilled with Java, C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Lua, but I am also moderately capable with Rust, C, and C++. Many of my projects are built with Node.JS, since I find it useful for rapid prototyping. My technical interests include virtual machines, emulation, web development, and game development, plus a mild fascination with cybersecurity. On the side, I do graphic design and """art""" using the Adobe suite. Occasionally I use Figma to mock up graphical user interfaces. Most of my projects on GitHub were created for my own use, and are demonstrative solely of my programming skills and not my UX design skills.
