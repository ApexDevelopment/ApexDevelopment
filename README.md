## Hi, I'm Micah. <sub>a.k.a Apex, Dream, and a few more names...</sub>

I am a programmer passionate about humane application design, ethical programming, and human-centered systems. The languages I am proficient with are Java, C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Lua, and I am currently learning to use Rust (does Batch count too?). Many of my projects are built with Node.JS because I happen to be skilled at rapid prototyping with it. My technical interests are virtual machines and emulation, web development, and game development, plus a mild fascination with cybersecurity. On the side I do graphic design and """art""" using the Adobe suite. Occasionally I use Figma to mock up graphical user interfaces. Most of my projects on GitHub were built for my own use, and so are better demonstrations of just my programming skills rather than my UX design skills.
