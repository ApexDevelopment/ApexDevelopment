<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Micah.</h1>
<p align="center"><sup>a.k.a Apex, and a few more names...</sup></p>

I am a programmer passionate about UI/UX design. I'm familiar with Java, C#, C, C++, Lua, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I build lots of stuff with Node.js, I find it useful for rapid prototyping. My technical interests include virtual machines, emulation, web development, and game development, plus a mild interest in cybersecurity. Sometimes I do graphic design. If that sounds cool, you should hire me!
