I am a programmer passionate about accessible application design. I am most skilled with Java, C#, Lua, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but I am also capable with C and C++. Many of my projects are built with Node.JS, since I find it useful for rapid prototyping. My technical interests include virtual machines, emulation, web development, and game development, plus a mild interest in cybersecurity. Sometimes, I do graphic design in Adobe tools. Most of my projects on GitHub were created for my own use.
