## Hi, I'm Micah. <sub><sup>a.k.a Apex, Dream, and a few more names...</sup></sub>

I am a programmer passionate about humane application design, ethical programming, and human-centered systems. The languages I am proficient with are Java, C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Lua, and I am currently learning to use Rust. Many of my projects are built with Node.JS, since I happen to be skilled at using it for rapid prototyping. My technical interests include virtual machines, emulation, web development, and game development, plus a mild fascination with cybersecurity. On the side I do graphic design and """art""" using the Adobe suite. Occasionally I use Figma to mock up graphical user interfaces. Most of my projects on GitHub were built for my own use, and therefore are better demonstrations of my programming skills alone, rather than my UX design skills.
